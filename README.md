This project was created as part of a school program.

We had the constraint of using at least three data structures, like lists, stacks, and vectors

We were in a rush while making this, so don't look at the code unless you're hungry for spaghetti.

# Contains
- Infinite amount of levels with progressing difficulty and two types of recipes : Pizzas and Hamburgers
- Settings to change the music, the difficulty and to turn off the volume
